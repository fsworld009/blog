Quick note on my thought with Hexo.

Pros:
- **Static website (except comments)** : I can just publish my blog by using github pages, or any free web hosting service
- **Use GitHub flavored Markdown** : I think markdown is good for blogging, especially that you can just surround all code snippets with \`\`\` symbol without converting anything.
- **Easy to include image** : Each post can have a folder to include all assets, and then use Hexo tags to include them in the post.
- **Extensible** : Various plugins are available for Hexo.

Cons:
- **No way to customize color scheme in themes** : I've checked many Hexo themes and none of them provide options to adjust colors in _config.yml, looks like this is not encouraged.
- **No easy way to unpublish articles** : there is a publish command, but not unpublish. Right now I need to manually move artivles back to _draft folder to unpublish it.


More updates in future.
