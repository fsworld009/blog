My life had been busy from Aug 2016 to Aug 2017.
<!--more-->

Moved back to Taiwan in early 2017, then started the work with less than 2 weeks, then got really busy in my full time job, eventually I left the position.

I didn't get any time to do any side project during this period. Now  that I don't need to rush to land my next job at this time, I decided to take a long break and do whatever I've been thinking doing. Although the pace is rather slow right now...

Anyway, I have installed Arch Linux in Virtual Box on my Windows 10 PC, and I managed to rewrite my [portfolio website](https://fsworld009.github,io/) in Vue.js with VS Code. So far I am satisfied with all the hard work. Hopefully I can do more stuff during this break.

Since I moved back to Taiwan I will stop limiting myself only write blog posts in English, hope this will get me more motivated to write something down.
