  So, [Logdown](http://logdown.com/) is apparently not in active development anymore, which means I need to move again.


  I searched for alternatives for a while, one thing I want to have is the easiness of pasting codes.
Most blog services, such as Google blogger, doesn't support pasting codes. You either need to convert your code to HTML escaped string or find some scripts to help you. Unfortunately I cannot find any service that makes this task easier.



  Then I found [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), and [Ruhoh](http://ruhoh.com/). They are "Static site generator", which means you can configure and make posts on local side, then use these generators 
to generate a static html/css/js site. I like this idea, because this approach gives me more control on my blog, and I don't need any web hosting service, GitHub pages will be enough.


After a little bit research on static site generators, I found [Hexo](https://hexo.io) and I decided to give Hexo a try. It supports GitHub markdown, which I think will solve my concern on pasting codes.


So after 2 days try and error, here is my new blog, hopefully I won't abandon it too quick this time. 


Goal of this blog:
- Share my knowledge in programming or general computer stuffs.
- Served as a note/reference site for myself, in case I forgot something. 
- Practice English writing

Yes, my English sucks. So be prepared for a lot of grammar and spelling errors in this blog.
